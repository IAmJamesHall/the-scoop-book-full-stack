# 'The Scoop Book' In-store Messaging System
This is an in-store messaging system developed for Arrowhead Parable Christian Store.

It is a Twitter-like feed of messages from the manager and department heads. Users log in to view the messages using a shared login, while admins have a privileged account from which to add new messages.

This app also supports receiving messages from certain pre-approved phone numbers as SMS messages. These are mapped to a name in the database and published on the feed under that name.
